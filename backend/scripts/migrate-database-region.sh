# Move the Postgres database to a new Neon project in a nearer region.
#
# Neon cannot relocate a project, so this dumps the current database and
# restores it into a new one. The dataset is small (~16 MB), so the copy itself
# takes seconds — the risk is not volume, it is writes landing in the old
# database after the dump and being lost. Put the API in maintenance, or accept
# a short window where orders cannot be placed, before running this.
#
# Usage:
#   OLD_URL='postgresql://...us-east-1...'  \
#   NEW_URL='postgresql://...ap-south-1...' \
#   ./scripts/migrate-database-region.sh
#
# Nothing is dropped and the source is only ever read. Re-runnable: if the
# restore fails you can empty the new database and try again, and the old one is
# untouched either way.

The new database now matches the old one.

Still to do, in this order:
  1. Point DATABASE_URL at the new project (Render dashboard, and .env locally).
  2. Redeploy the API so it picks up the new URL.
  3. Place one real test order end to end.
  4. Keep the old Neon project for at least a week before deleting it.

Nothing was dropped. The old database is still live and still receiving no
harm — if anything looks wrong, point DATABASE_URL back at it.
