/**
 * Turning a completed Shiprocket Checkout (Fastrr) checkout into a Tatvivah order.
 *
 * Three independent triggers call in here — the order webhook, the callback page
 * polling after the buyer is redirected back, and the reconciliation sweep — and
 * Fastrr's own docs warn that webhooks may be delivered more than once. So the
 * single most important property of this file is that running it twice for the
 * same checkout produces exactly one order. That is enforced in two layers:
 *
 *   1. `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on the session row serialises concurrent callers,
 *      so two of them cannot both pass the "already materialised?" check.
 *   2. `fastrr_checkout_sessions.order_id` is UNIQUE, so even if layer 1 were
 *      somehow bypassed the second insert fails rather than double-charging
 *      inventory.
 *
 * Nothing here trusts the webhook body. Whatever arrives, the order is built
 * from a fresh Order/Details call against Fastrr — that payload decides what the
 * buyer bought and what they paid, because it is the only version of those facts
 * that an attacker POSTing to our webhook URL cannot forge.
 *
 * GST: our catalog is published to Fastrr at the buyer-facing price, and Fastrr
 * charges exactly that — it never adds tax on top the way the native checkout
 * does. So tax is extracted *out of* the amount collected rather than added to
 * it. Same rupees to the buyer, correct split for the invoice and settlements.
