/**
 * Flow action shared by every website Add to Cart and Buy Now CTA.
 *
 * On hover a disc grows from the centre until it covers the button, the resting
 * commerce icon collapses out to the right and an arrow opens up on the left.
 * Its named group prevents a surrounding product-card hover from activating it.
 *
 * The icons ride in the flex row rather than being pinned to the button edges,
 * and they open and close by cancelling their own width with a negative margin.
 * That keeps the text-to-icon gap at exactly `gap-3` in both states — an
 * edge-pinned icon drifts further from the label the wider the button gets.
 *
 * Every transition names `scale` and `translate` explicitly: Tailwind v4 emits
 * those as standalone CSS properties, so a `transition-[transform]` never
 * animates them and the fill lands in a single frame.
