/**
 * The app's single icon language.
 *
 * Before this, the same idea was drawn three different ways: `heart` came from
 * Feather in one card and Ionicons in another, `menu` from both, and a Material
 * `grid-view` sat next to Ionicons outlines in the same bar. Three families
 * means three stroke weights, three corner treatments and three optical sizes
 * on one screen — which is the thing that actually reads as unfinished, far more
 * than any individual glyph does.
 *
 * Feather is the house set: a uniform thin stroke, geometric construction, no
 * decorative flourish. It is the closest of the bundled fonts to the editorial
 * line work luxury retail uses. Ionicons' outline variants fill the handful of
 * gaps — sparkles, shirt, scan — where Feather has no equivalent and where a
 * near-match would read worse than a considered substitute.
 *
 * Everything routes through the map below, so restyling the whole app's
 * iconography later is a single-file edit rather than another 80-site sweep.
