/**
 * Return the shopper to the screen they left, after Android kills the process.
 *
 * Android reclaims backgrounded apps under memory pressure, and several OEMs
 * common in India (Xiaomi, Realme, Oppo, Vivo) do it far more aggressively than
 * stock. When that happens the whole JS runtime is gone: the app cold-starts and
 * expo-router lands on its initial route. To the shopper it looks like the app
 * "forgot" where they were — they were on a product, switched to WhatsApp, came
 * back, and are staring at the home screen.
 *
 * There is no way to stop the OS killing the process. What can be fixed is
 * coming back to the right place, so the kill is invisible.
 *
 * The last route is recorded as it changes and replayed once on the next cold
 * start. Deliberately conservative about what it will restore:
 *
 *   · Only within RESTORE_WINDOW_MS. Returning after a day should feel like
 *     opening the app fresh, not resuming a stale session.
 *   · Never into a transient flow. Checkout, payment and auth screens depend on
 *     in-memory state that died with the process — dropping someone back into a
 *     half-finished payment would be worse than sending them home.
 *   · Once per launch, and never over a deep link. If the app was opened by a
 *     notification or a shared product link, that destination wins.
